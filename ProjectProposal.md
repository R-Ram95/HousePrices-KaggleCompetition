# Project proposal for *YOUR PROJECT TITEL*
Author: Rohinesh Ram

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt
I will compete in the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition on Kaggle because it will allow me to learn more about feature engineering and advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting. 

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt
I signed up for Kaggle and I see that there are four tutorials for the competition. I will use the tutorials for reference along with feature engineering and regression notes from ENSF 611. I will also rely heavily on the Lab 2 notebook for reference and as a template. 

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview/description
- SciKit Learn regressors: RandomForest, GradientBoosting
- I also might try and use XGBoost as I head in class that XGBoost algorithms perform well in Kaggle competitions
